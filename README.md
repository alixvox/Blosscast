Wherether is an open-sourced terminal application that uses wttr.in to access weather data for a city.

OPERATION:
1. Run the file in your terminal by navigating to the main directory and typing "./"
followed by either "Wherether" or [TAB], depending on if using [TAB] autofills the text or not.
2. Type the name of the city you would like to select (Use spaces for cities with multiple words)
and press [ENTER]. If no city is entered, wttr.in will default to the city your IP address is located in.
3. After viewing the forecast, press [ANY KEY] to exit the program.
